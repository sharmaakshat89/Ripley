# Tasks: Source Code Ingestion & Unified Corpus

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/101-code-ingestion/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Test-Alongside approach required per constitution - unit and integration tests included

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**STATUS**: MVP Complete ✅ - US1, US2, US3, US4, US6 implemented and tested. US5 (AST-aware chunking) pending.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1, US2, US6 can proceed in parallel (both P1)
  - US3, US4 can proceed after US1/US2 (P2)
  - US5 can proceed after foundational chunking (P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Foundation → Independent MVP capability
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Foundation → Requires US1 for data to search
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Foundation → Independent filtering capability
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Foundation → Independent summarization capability
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Foundation → Independent AST chunking improvement
- **User Story 6 (P1)**: Foundation + US1/US2 → SDK corpus capability

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- US1, US2, US6 can be worked on in parallel after Foundation
- US3, US4, US5 can be worked on in parallel after Foundation
- CLI updates in Polish phase can run in parallel
- Documentation updates in Polish phase can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Stories 1 & 2

```bash
# Launch US1 and US2 in parallel after Foundation complete:
Task: "Extend DocumentLoader.load_files() to support code file extensions"
Task: "Update /query endpoint with source_type and language filtering"

# Launch CLI enhancements in parallel during Polish phase:
Task: "Update agent-brain index command with --include-code flags"
Task: "Update agent-brain query command with --source-type filters"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2 & 6 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (code indexing)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (unified search)
5. Complete Phase 8: User Story 6 (SDK corpus)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test cross-reference search independently
7. Deploy/demo MVP with basic code ingestion

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** → Setup + Foundational phases
2. **MVP** → US1 + US2 + US6 (code indexing + unified search + SDK corpus)
3. **Enhanced** → US3 + US4 (language filtering + summaries)
4. **Polished** → US5 + Polish phase (AST chunking + docs)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Foundation**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. **MVP Sprint**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (code indexing)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (unified search)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (SDK corpus validation)
3. **Enhancement Sprint**:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (language filtering)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (summaries)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (AST chunking)
4. **Polish Sprint**: All developers on CLI, docs, testing

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- All tasks include exact file paths for implementation
- MVP scope: US1 + US2 + US6 provides core code ingestion + search capability
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence</content>
